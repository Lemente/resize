Minetest mod prototype: resize
Warning: This is a prototype. It isn't ready for gameplay yet. Might not work as expected.

allows to resize a specific player ingame using the command: /resize <player> <size>

how to improve it:
- make fall damages proportionnal to size
- make interact distance proportionnal to size
- make size 1.8 behave like default size (need to find the right numbers)
- allow player to break/build multiple nodes at once
- allow player to step one nodes according to their size (roughly 1/4 of their size)
- set size in .conf
- set size for all players
- make compatible with sneak mod
- add command /getsize <player>
